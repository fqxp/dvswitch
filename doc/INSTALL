DVswitch: a basic video mixer for live DV streams
=================================================

Installation
------------

From version 0.9, DVswitch will use the RTSP and RTP protocols with
the aid of the liveMedia library (aka LIVE555), version 2010.01.15
or later.

You will need to build that first:
    cd ..
    wget http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz
    tar xzf live555-latest.tar.gz
    cd live
    ./genMakefiles linux
    make

Now build DVswitch:
    cd ../dvswitch
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -D LiveMedia_BUILDDIR=$PWD/../../live ..
    make

The DVswitch commands will be built in the subdirectory 'build/src'.
You can install them with:
    make install

liveMedia only builds static libraries and does not need to be
installed.
